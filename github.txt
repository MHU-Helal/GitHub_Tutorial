Steps to work with Github:
01 For starting with new project we can create project folder in Github or in our local directory.

02 When created repository in Github, we have to set the remote origin in our local directory.

03 Add new modifications in git. (Git add .)
04 Git commit -m "Github.txt file added where steps are discussed." (To record each updates of the project in github)
05 Git push (To update the contents of the local directory with github repository)
06 git push --set-upstream origin master (To set the git repository branch)
